Quality Assessment and Quality Control of Response Variable


**Step 0: Prerequisites**

Before we can run the QA/QC Dashboard on NDSU CCAST, make sure you have the following ready:

1. NDSU Email Address
    You must have an active NDSU email (e.g., firstname.lastname@ndsu.edu).

2. Apply for a CCAST Account

   * Go to: <a href="https://www.ndsu.edu/ccast" target="_blank">https://www.ndsu.edu/ccast</a>

   * Fill out the online form to request a CCAST account.
   *  You will get an email once your account has been approved.



3 . Login with Bison Credentials
    Once approved, simply log in to the CCAST portal at https://ondemand.ccast.ndsu.edu

Use the same email address and password that you already use for your NDSU Bison Login (same credentials you use for email, Blackboard, etc.).
